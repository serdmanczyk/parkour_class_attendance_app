Generic Class Log App
==================

This is a generic class attendance logging application using Python [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) built for [OpenShift](http://openshift.redhat.com).  It also implements [Flask Oauth](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-OAuth/) for simple validation through google as well as Pure CSS and JQuery UI to enhance user interface elements.

Class attendance is modeled after hosting classes on a come-as-you can basis rather than on marking expected attendances as tardy, absent, etc.  Marking attendance is made easy by autocompleting the submission form as you type student names (assuming matching names exist in the students database collection).

For more info, check out my blog post on the application: [http://serdmanczyk.github.io/ClassAtttendanceApp/](http://serdmanczyk.github.io/ClassAtttendanceApp/).
